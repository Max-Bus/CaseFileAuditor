**How to Use**
---
The app requests an input location where you store all of the files for a particular case and an output location to store its diagnosis report. The report contains information pertaining to the kind of injuries involved and other relevant information. It will appear within the app itself but will also be saved to the output location. If you would like more instructions, there is a guide within the app near the top of the page.
